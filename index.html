    <h1>SOMEONE</h1>
    <div class="poem">Sometimes I think I am all alone.
        <br>
        Depressed with tonnes of thoughts,
        <br>
        Should I do this or that?
        confused like a plant supported by a rod
        ....all the way twined.
        <br>
        I think I am in search of someone who can understand me,
        <br>
        who instead of judging me , support me
        <br>
        who instead of ignoring me, be around me
        <br>
        and just be with me , when I need someone the most
        <br>
        not just vanishing out of blue in the sky like smoke.
        <br>
        And guess what this SOMEONE is still not known
        <br>
        That's why I think I am all alone.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to be that butterfly,
        <br>
        Who emerges from the cocoon with beautiful colorful wings
        <br>
        and fly high in the sky.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to be that daffodil,
        <br>
        whose beauty is cherished in springs 
        <br>
        and whose beautiful yellow color
        <br>
        reflects brightness and zing.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to be those giant trees,
        <br>
        who stood like brave soldiers amidst harsh weather and storm
        <br>
        beautiful again in sunshine, purifying the enviroment
        <br>
        doing everything by its norm.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to beautifully fly high and be strong.
        <br>
        But my anxiety says my soul...
        <br>
        Hmmm lets just ignore.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Going deep in my thoughts.
        <br>
        in a hope to untangle the mess,
        <br>
        all I see were the junk of unanswered questions
        <br>
        screaming loud for solution.
        <br>
        From those pile of junk a question screamed,
        <br>
        Hey girl!!! are you still in a dream?
        <br>
        "You might be in search of someone but let me tell you we are in search of you"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Little did I know that my problem in already solved.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Looking in the mirror I said to myself,
        <br>
        Hey SOMEONE
        <br>
        Haven't you took so much time.
